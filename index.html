                    <h2><u>His Comeback</u></h2>
                    <p>But he would get better all in part because of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA_3mBOoexs">Burger King burger</a>. Robert Downey Jr. says that his career was saved by a burger by Burger King, and other things. The story goes that in 2003 while driving across the US. He stopped to eat with his car full of drugs and ate a horrible tasting burger that made him rethink his whole life to that point. That made him just want to change himself. And Downey’s wife Susan Downey told Harper’s Bazaar that he quit drugs for good in 2003 after she gave him an ultimatum. Apparently, it stuck. According to a 2013 Daily Mail article, the actor credits a combination of 12-step programs, yoga, meditation and therapy with keeping him sober.</p>
