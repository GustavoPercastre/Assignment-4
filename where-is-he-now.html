    <p>Downey’s star-power rose in 2008 when he starred in the 2008 summer blockbusters Iron Man and Tropic Thunder, earning his second Oscar nomination for the latter. Downey then starred in The Avengers in 2012. He has since starred in subsequent Iron Man movies as well as numerous other movies in the Marvel universe, making him a critical player for Marvel. In addition, he has filled roles in two Sherlock Holmes movies and other movies that continue to show his talent and range as an actor.</p>
    <p>Where once he was viewed as toxic, Downey now finds himself in a place where studios and directors are seeking him out. Now in recovery for more than 15 years, he fact that Robert Downey Jr.’s career seems to improve the longer he stays sober makes his comeback one of the most impressive and inspiring stories.</p>
